# python-projects
Welcome, my friend! This is the place where I collect all my Python projects.

Here you'll find various projects I built with Python.

Each folder is a separate project with code, documentation, and usage instructions if available.

These projects show my learning journey and experience.

Feel free to explore, use, improve, or even contribute!

Project List:

Project 1: Google Maps Market Scraper: Scraped market data like addresses and phone numbers from Google Maps using Scrapy.
